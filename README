NAME
    rinetd.pl - tcp redirection server

SYNOPSIS
    rinetd.pl [ -c configfile ] [ -f ] { start | stop | reload | restart |
    check }

DESCRIPTION
    Rinetd.pl forwards tcp connections from one IP address and port to
    another. rinetd.pl can forward from multiple ports simultaneously as
    defined in a config file (/etc/rinetd.pl.conf).

    Rinetd.pl is called "rinetd.pl" instead of simply "rinetd" so as to not
    be confused with Thomas Boutell's "rinetd" program.

    Exactly one of imperitive is required on the command line:

    start    Start a new rinetd server if there isn't one already running.

    stop     Stop a running rinetd server

    restart  Stop the running rinetd server (if one is running). Start a new
             rinetd server.

    reload   Reconfigure the running rinetd server. Start a new server if
             none is running.

    The command line options are:

    -c file  Specify an alternative configuration file. Multiple rinetd.pl
             servers can run simultaneously if they have different config
             files.

    -f       Run in the foreground. Normally rinetd.pl detaches itself and
             runs as a deamon. When it runs as a daemon it redirects its
             output through the logger(1) program.

FORWARDING RULES
    The format for forwarding rules (in the config file) is:

     from-ip-address from-port to-ip-address to-port

    IP addresses and ports can be numeric or named. Use 0.0.0.0 for
    listening on all IP addresses.

FILTER RULES
    Allow and deny rules can control what IP addresses are allowed to use
    the server.

    The format of rules is:

     allow|deny netblock

    Filters that follow a forwarding rule apply to that forwarding rule
    only.

    Filters that preceed any forwarding rules apply to all forwarding rules
    if no per-forwarding rule filter matches.

    Filters are not ordered: the most specific filter (smallest network
    block) that matches is the one that is used.

    Filter rules may be indented for clarity. Filter rules must be numeric
    -- hostnames are not allowed.

EXAMPLE CONFIG
     # We have to start with the global access 
     # control list.
     # The order of the rules does not matter.

     deny   any             # '0.0.0.0/0' and 'default' work too
     deny   216.240.32.1 
     allow  216.240.32/24

     allow  216.240.47/24
